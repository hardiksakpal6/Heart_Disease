# Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
This repository contains a dataset for predicting the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) based on various attributes. The dataset comprises 3811 samples with 16 attributes. Each sample is labeled as either having a risk of CHD or not having a risk.

## Attributes
male: Binary attribute indicating gender (1 for male, 0 for female).
age: Age of the individual.
education: Level of education.
currentSmoker: Binary attribute indicating whether the individual is a current smoker (1 for yes, 0 for no).
cigsPerDay: Number of cigarettes smoked per day.
BPMeds: Binary attribute indicating whether the individual is on blood pressure medication.
prevalentStroke: Binary attribute indicating whether the individual has had a stroke.
prevalentHyp: Binary attribute indicating prevalent hypertension.
diabetes: Binary attribute indicating whether the individual has diabetes.
totChol: Continuous attribute representing cholesterol level.
sysBP: Continuous attribute representing systolic blood pressure.
diaBP: Continuous attribute representing diastolic blood pressure.
BMI: Continuous attribute representing Body Mass Index.
heartRate: Heart rate of the individual.
glucose: Continuous attribute representing glucose level.
TenYearCHD: Binary attribute indicating the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Data Usage
This dataset can be utilized for predictive modeling tasks, particularly for predicting the risk of coronary heart disease based on the given attributes. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to this dataset to build models that accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing CHD within the next ten years.
